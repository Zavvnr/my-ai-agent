This is a Personal Project

my-ai-agent was made with the help of google gemini. The purpose of this agent is to send an email to brief me in the morning about things that I need to do alongside a quote for the day and the weather condition. The reason for making this is because my habit of checking my email each morning to look for news, opportunities, etc. 

The program works by fetching data through weather API, canvas API, and gemini-1.5 flash (gemini 2.0-2.5 version is still unavailable to use for developers). Using tokens generated by google, weather API, and canvas API. The email sender is set to my personal email while the receiver is my school outlook email. This program will hopefully continue to improve my flexibility in desiding my actions and will continuously be improved with new ideas.

Starting next month, I am designing certain transitions to from using API to using model-context protocol (MCP) to for this project. This aims to 
  1. Provide dynamic API integration
  2. Improve accuracy using real-time data
  3. Reduce program complexity
  4. Learn more about MCP itself
